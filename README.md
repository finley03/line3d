# line3d

## Simple web based 3d engine

Displays objects as wireframe and also hidden line (early, quite buggy)

Right now it's somewhat basic but the featureset is quickly building.

Any contributions would be greatly appreciated

Currently the objects and camera have full freedom of movement

You can also add extra objects to display. Examples in line3d.js

### Controls

* scroll to zoom
* middle click + drag to revolve
* display menu on the right
* object menu on the left
* select objects with buttons at the botton
* press 't' to enter translate mode

### Current Features

* some mouse controls
* rotate objects on all 3 axes
* translate objects in all 3 directions
* move camera to any position
* rotate camera to point in any direction

* hidden line (finally)

### In the works
