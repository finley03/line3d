## Simple web based 3d engine

Displays objects as wireframe (currently)

Right now it's somewhat basic but the featureset is quickly building.

Currently the objects and camera have full freedom of movement

You can also add extra objects to display. Examples in line3d.js

### Current Features

* rotate objects on all 3 axes
* translate objects in all 3 directions
* move camera to any position
* rotate camera to point in any direction
* accurate perspective
* multiple independent objects
* coordinate system display
* base plane

### In the works

* .obj file support
* more complete ui

### Coming (probably)

* hide/fade lines on back side of object
* shaded polygons
* animation features
* orbital mechanics

more if I have the time
